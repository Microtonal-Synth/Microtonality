        Easley Blackwood's microtonal etudes provide a number of difficulties to overcome in order to
        produce a full performance. You can read about the ideas to tackle these challenges in the
        paper below.

        The microtonal synthesizer available on the Download page was produced by Computer
        Science majors completing their Senior Design Projects at the University of Central Florida
        (listed below). The synthesizer (created using the JUCE framework) includes tone generators,
        ADSR envelope controls, microtonal scale generation and keyboard mapping functionality, and
        components for saving mappings and instruments.

        This project also engages students in the School of Performing Arts at the University of Central
        Florida (listed below). Music students work on notation projects to convert microtonal notation
        into easily readable, comprehensible, and gesturally practicable notation for the purpose of
        performance on the microtonal synthesizer using a standard keyboard controller.
